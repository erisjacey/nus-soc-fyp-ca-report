\chapter{Introduction}

This project is being built on the backbone of the ITS we have been developing.
Some features of this system include providing an automated approach to APR,
providing students with tailored and dynamic feedback, as well as a robust auto-grader.

\section{Project Objectives}

One of the preliminary steps in the ITS framework requires the refactoring of reference correct
solutions in the hopes of more closely matching incorrect student programs.
As such, the first part of this project involves the implementation of refactoring rules as
outlined by an APR-centered paper~\cite{hu2019re}.
These rules, implemented in the ITS backend, are intended to improve the robustness of the
application.

Subsequently, the second part revolves around investigating large language models (LLMs),
specifically Codex, and their efficacy in the APR process for CS-1 programming assignments.
Through this research portion of the project, we aim to make use of Codex in the most
effective way possible for our use case, which is to increase the efficiency of both
teachers' grading performance and students' learning ease.
