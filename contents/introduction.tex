\chapter{Introduction}

This project is being built on the backbone of the ITS we have been developing.
Some features of this system include providing an automated approach to APR,
providing students with tailored and dynamic feedback, as well as a robust auto-grader.

\section{Project Objectives}

One of the preliminary steps in the ITS framework requires the refactoring of reference correct
solutions in the hopes of more closely matching incorrect student programs.
As such, the first part of this project involves the implementation of refactoring rules as
outlined by an APR-centered paper~\cite{hu2019re}.
Subsequently, the second part revolves around investigating large language models (LLMs),
specifically Codex, and their efficacy in the APR process for CS-1 programming assignments.
