\paragraph{Improving automatically generated code from Codex via Automated Program Repair}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Existing APR techniques like TBar and Recoder have their limitations in the context of
          fixing bugs in auto-generated programs.
    \item Codex-e has the potential of outperforming TBar and Recoder in code edit generation.
    \item The conventional way in which APR for introductory programming assignments still relies
          on referencing a rich reference solution set for the same assignment
    \item We propose:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A matching mechanism to be able to search for similar past submissions from past
              assignments, which can then be used by language models.
        \item An incorrect fix guided refinement mechanism to further improve matching quality
              and repair success rate.
        \item An evaluation of the approach in real student submissions and showing of the value
              of historical assignments in APR
    \end{itemize}
