\begin{abstract}
Test citation here\cite{ahmed2022verifix}.
The use of Wireless Sensor Networks for environmental monitoring has become
increasingly popular over the past decade due to its affordability, ease of deployment
and customisation, as well as its potentiality in the processing of sensed data. One of the
greatest challenges in this field would be in the design and implementation of an
efficient routing protocol which takes into account the various limitations of Wireless
Sensor Networks, such as battery life, limited storage capacities and high probability of
packet losses. Besides this, it is also extremely difficult to evaluate the performance of
such a protocol under crisis scenarios, due to its infrequency and unpredictability. In our
work, we have designed a routing protocol based on optimised Virtual Polar Coordinate
Routing (VPCR) (Newsome and Song, 2003) for use with our three-dimensional
testbed, comprising of 48 MICAz (Crossbow) motes spread across two floors of a
building. We have also developed a Java-based application with features for Event
Emulation and simple nodal analysis to assist us in our experiments. The overall
performance of our protocol will be gauged based on the average Path Stretch Factor
and path length comparisons between optimised and na√Øve VPCR.
